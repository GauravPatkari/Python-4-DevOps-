''' #GloblaL Keyword:- It used to declare that a variable inside a function as Global for further use in the program.
                       It exists in the global scope. As we know variables declared insdie a function are local
                       to that function. Using the 'global' keyword we can modify a variable ouside the fucntion of the current scope.
